                    Vertige Investment Group is a student organization based at the University of Toronto, established
                    to provide its members with opportunities to engage in financial research and develop their
                    understanding of the finance industry. It is important to understand that Vertige Investment Group
                    is not an incorporated body, partnership, or legal entity of any kind. The organization operates
                    purely as an educational entity, driven by students for the benefit of student learning and
                    experience. The research publications produced by Vertige Investment Group are created with the sole
                    purpose of enhancing educational knowledge and should in no way be interpreted as professional
                    investment advice. These publications are the result of student efforts, relying on publicly
                    available information and academic resources. Consequently, the accuracy, completeness, and
                    reliability of the research cannot be guaranteed. The content presented is intended to foster
                    academic discussion and learning among students and should not be used as the basis for making
                    real-world investment decisions. Members of Vertige Investment Group are students who do not possess
                    any professional licenses or certifications. They engage in research activities as part of their
                    educational development, without the oversight or endorsement of any regulatory bodies. The insights
                    and analyses presented in Vertige's publications reflect the students' academic understanding and
                    interpretations, and not those of certified financial professionals. Given these circumstances, it
                    is crucial for readers and recipients of Vertige Investment Group's research publications to
                    exercise caution and seek advice from certified financial advisors before making any investment
                    decisions. Vertige Investment Group disclaims any responsibility for any losses or damages incurred
                    as a result of relying on the information contained in its publications.

                    RATINGS AND DEFINITIONS</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Vertige Investment Group (Canada) Definitions: Outperform (MO2): The stock is projected to
                    appreciate and outperform the respective sector over the next 12 months. Market Perform (MP3): The
                    stock is expected to perform roughly in line with the respective sector over the next 12 months and
                    could potentially be used as a source of funds for higher-rated securities. Underperform (MU4): The
                    stock is forecasted to underperform the respective sector over the next six to 12 months and should
                    be sold. Suspended (S): The rating and price target have been temporarily suspended. This may be due
                    to market events that have made coverage impractical, or to comply with regulations or firm policies
                    under certain circumstances. The previous rating and price target are no longer valid and should not
                    be relied upon.
                </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Vertige Investment Group (U.S.) Definitions: Outperform (MO2): Expected to appreciate or outperform
                    the respective sector over the next 12-18 months. For higher-yielding and more conservative
                    equities, such as REITs and certain MLPs, this rating is used for securities where the relative
                    safety of the dividend is acceptable and a total return modestly exceeding the dividend yield is
                    anticipated over the next 12-18 months. Market Perform (MP3): Expected to perform generally in line
                    with the respective sector over the next 12 months. Underperform (MU4): Expected to underperform the
                    respective sector over the next six to 12 months and should be sold. Suspended (S): The rating and
                    price target have been temporarily suspended. This may be due to market events that have made
                    coverage impractical, or to comply with applicable regulations or firm policies in certain
                    circumstances. The previous rating and price target are no longer effective and should not be relied
                    upon.

                    SUITABILITY RATINGS (SR)</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5rem;">
                    Medium Risk/Income (M/INC): Equities with lower to average risk from companies that have sound
                    financials, consistent earnings, and dividend yields exceeding that of the S&P 500. These securities
                    are often designed to provide a reliable dividend or return of capital. Medium Risk/Growth (M/GRW):
                    Equities with lower to average risk from companies boasting sound financials, consistent earnings
                    growth, potential for long-term price appreciation, a possible dividend yield, and/or share
                    repurchase programs. High Risk/Income (H/INC): Equities with medium to higher risk from companies
                    that focus on delivering a significant dividend but may experience less predictable earnings (or
                    losses), more leveraged balance sheets, volatile market conditions, financial and competitive
                    challenges, and higher price volatility (beta), along with potential principal risk. Income streams
                    from dividends or capital distributions in this category may be less predictable. High Risk/Growth
                    (H/GRW): Equities with medium to higher risk from companies in fast-growing and competitive sectors,
                    facing less predictable earnings (or losses), more leveraged balance sheets, fluctuating market
                    dynamics, financial or legal challenges, higher price volatility (beta), and potential principal
                    risk. High Risk/Speculation (H/SPEC): Equities with high risk from companies with short or
                    unprofitable operating histories, limited or unpredictable revenues, very high success risks,
                    significant financial or legal issues, or substantial risk of principal loss.
